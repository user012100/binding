				<h2>Perception</h2>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.barragan-foundation.org">Luis Barragán</a> was an architect from Mexico. He won a <a href="https://www.pritzkerprize.com">Pritzker Prize</a> in 1980. I can vouch for this. I saw the trophy in his house (casa). It looks like a mini <a href="https://www.henry-moore.org/">Henry Moore</a> sculpture.
				</p>
				<p>
					It actually is a mini Henry Moore sculpture. For the first eight years of the Pritzker they used the mini Henry Moore as the Prize’s medal. The current Pritzker Prize looks like a gold-wrapped chocolate coin.
				</p>
				<p>
					Born wealthy in Guadalajara, Mexico, Luis Barragán studied engineering. After graduation, he traveled to Spain and France where he became inspired by the gardens and writings of <a href="https://www.iconichouses.org/specials/les-colombieres/ferdinand-bac">Ferdinand Bac</a>. Bac created Mediterranean fantasies with fountains, arches, and plants that spilled over stone paths. Leaves, not flowers. Bac didn’t dig flowers. After finding Bac, Barragán became an architect and gardener. The first home he built was in Guadalajara (1928). The place was hooked on Bac with arches and weepy greenery.
				</p>
				<p>
					Barragán visited France again in 1935. This time he met <a href="https://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/">Le Corbusier</a> and saw the arch-free <a href="https://www.villa-savoye.fr">Villa Savoye</a>. When he returned, Barragán moved to Mexico City and built a white boxy modernist apartment building.
				</p>
				<p>
					In Mexico City Barragán began hanging out with the self-taught artist <a href="https://www.esmeralda.edu.mx/chucho-reyes?lang=en">Chucho Reyes</a>, and his work shifted. He found his own path.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I were on the Pritzker’s board, the first thing I would do is bring back the mini Henry Moore trophy and ditch the chocolate coin. This is not going to happen. I am not on the board. I am not an architect. I am not Mexican. Know that from the get-go.
				</p>
				<p>
					<a href="https://casaluisbarragan.org">Casa Luis Barragán</a> is a UNESCO site. It was the architect’s home and studio. There are floating stairs that people are not allowed to climb and windows with shutters that form a cross of light. Gazing balls, pink walls, yellow beams, and more. It sounds like a lot, but if you are there in person it is not. Some rooms feel like monks’ cells.
				</p>
				<p>
					Near the house’s overgrown (on purpose) garden hangs a fake <a href="https://cedarandhyde.com/blogs/journal/luis-barragan-visit-mexico-city">Josef Albers painting</a>.
				</p>
				<div class="divider"></div>
				<h2>Reproduction</h2>
				<p>
					The painting is tan within yellow within yellow. It is a copy of Homage to the Square, the painting Albers painted over and over and over for 26 years. All of Albers’s Homages use color straight from the tube. All are nested squares painted on primed masonite. There are more than 2,000 versions of Homage to the Square made by Albers. They live all over the world — none of them in Casa Luis Barragán. Albers knew about Barragán’s bootleg. He respected Barragán and was flattered by it. They met more than once. They liked each other.
				</p>
				<section>
					<p>
						Experience teaches that in visual perception there is a discrepancy between physical fact and psychic effect.
					</p>
				</section>
				<p>
					He taught the idea using color, but believed it could be applied to all areas of life. Albers described the aim of his teachings as “to open eyes,” and he believed that doctors and lawyers would benefit from this as much as artists.
				</p>
				<p>
					Josef Albers was born (1888) in Westphalia, Germany. He was already a school teacher when he went to learn at the Bauhaus (1920). Two years later he started teaching there alongside <a href="https://www.zpk.org">Paul Klee</a> and <a href="https://www.centrepompidou.fr/en/resources/person/a5rEdR">Wassily Kandinsky</a>. He taught at the Bauhaus till Nazi ideology and threats of war forced the school to close.
				</p>
				<p>
					Albers was invited to escape the war and become a teacher at <a href="https://www.blackmountaincollege.org">Black Mountain College</a> in North Carolina (1933). There he went with his wife <a href="https://www.albersfoundation.org/artists/anni-albers">Anni</a>. He taught in the same way he did at the Bauhaus — learn by doing, practice before theory.
				</p>
				<p>
					Anni also taught at Black Mountain. But her passion was weaving. In 1935 the Albers took a road trip to Mexico from Black Mountain and fell in love with the country, especially its pre-Hispanic art, colors, and textiles. The Albers drove there every summer until they moved to Connecticut in 1950, where Josef became Chairman of Design at the <a href="https://art.yale.edu">Yale University School of Art</a>. <a href="https://www.albersfoundation.org/about/nicholas-fox-weber">Nicholas Fox Weber</a> of the Albers Foundation recalls:
				</p>
				<section>
					<p>
						Albers enjoyed pointing out the way that spoken and written language could be misleading; when he would drive or give visitors directions to his modest suburban home in the Connecticut town of Orange, he would joyfully point out a green road sign with white lettering that announced “This is Orange.”
					</p>
				</section>
				<p>
					Josef Albers lived in a town called Orange!
				</p>
				<p>
					Before he spent 26 years painting the same painting, Albers created exercises that made the same color look different or different colors look the same. He made colors lie. He made colors linger.
				</p>
				<p>
					He made people understand what they perceived.
				</p>
				<p>
					Barragán used vivid colors in his architecture. He used the colors in a way that connects directly to Albers’s teachings.
				</p>
				<p>
					A wall looks yellow but is really white. Light is reflected in a gold painting to give a hot pink wall texture. Cold is made warm. Warm is made cold.
				</p>
				<p>
					Barragán is so well known for his use of color that the Mexican paint company <a href="https://www.pintex.mx">Pintex</a> sells signature colors based on those at <a href="https://casagilardi.org.mx">Casa Gilardi</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Casa Gilardi is the last house Barragán designed.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are some other fake works of art in Casa Luis Barragán. A blow-up of a drawing by <a href="https://www.nga.gov/artists/5136-jose-clemente-orozco">José Clemente Orozco</a> butts up against a wall. A copy of <a href="https://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/guernica">Picasso’s Guernica</a> sits above a chest of drawers. In one of the bedrooms there is a homemade tribute to Iman, the supermodel.
				</p>
				<section>
					<p>
						According to his friend and colleague, architect <a href="https://archeyes.com/tag/andres-casillas/">Andrés Casillas</a>, Barragán came across the printed fabric in a department store on a visit to the U.S. in the early 1960s, and bought it for “one dollar each,” proclaiming them perfect for his house. Albers, demonstrating a parallel lack of pretension, approved.
